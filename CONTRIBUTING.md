2. Create a branch of yours to make your contributions: creating a branch allows you to separate your changes from the main branch which can later be added to the main branch if there is no error or conflict. Else, discarded.

![branch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53593233/195101930-5bcc6a38-9fa6-477c-a702-86147296aeac.PNG)

Input the name of your branch and then click "Create branch: branch-name" slightly below the branch name input area


3. When you are done creating the branch, you can start making your contributions.
